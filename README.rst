==============

Set up and run `RDFox`_ scripts in a temporary directory.

Requires RDFox version 5.0 or greater for the `RDFoxEndpoint.add_triples` method.

`rdfox_runner` is tested against the latest version of RDFox (currently 5.6).


Description
===========

This Python package provides functions for running RDFox in a functional way: mapping from input facts/rules to output facts/answers. It hides the process of setting up RDFox scripts and input files in a temporary directory, running RDFox, and extracting the results. It can also be used to interact with an externally-running RDFox REST endpoint.

See the `documentation`_ for more details.


Installation
============

Install rdfox_runner using pip:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install rdfox_runner
