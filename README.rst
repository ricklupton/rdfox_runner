 rdfox_runner
==============

Set up and run `RDFox`_ scripts in a temporary directory.

Requires RDFox version 5.0 or greater for the `RDFoxEndpoint.add_triples` method.

`rdfox_runner` is tested against the latest version of RDFox (currently 5.6).


Description
===========

This Python package provides functions for running RDFox in a functional way: mapping from input facts/rules to output facts/answers. It hides the process of setting up RDFox scripts and input files in a temporary directory, running RDFox, and extracting the results. It can also be used to interact with an externally-running RDFox REST endpoint.

See the `documentation`_ for more details.


Installation
============

Install rdfox_runner using pip:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install rdfox_runner

Changes
=======

v0.5.0
------

Add new endpoint method `query_raw` which returns the response from RDFox directly, rather than parsing into an `rdflib` Graph. If the Python Graph representation is not needed, and the response is large, this is much faster.

v0.4.3
------

Raise an error when RDFox execution stops due to error policy `on-error = "stop"`.

v0.4.2
------

Quit RDFox when an error happens with error policy `on-error = "stop"` also while waiting for endpoint to start (fixing an infinite wait).

v0.4.1
------

Quit RDFox when an error happens with error policy `on-error = "stop"`.

v0.4.0
------

`RDFoxRunner` is no longer a subclass of `RDFoxEndpoint`, but it still returns an `RDFoxEndpoint` when used as a context manager. Thus most use should not need changing. The exception is the `RDFoxRunner.files` method, which now needs to be accessed on the original `RDFoxRunner` instance::

    runner = RDFoxRunner(input_files, script)
    with runner:  # not `with runner as rdfox:`
        output = runner.files(path)

Tested against RDFox version 5.6.
